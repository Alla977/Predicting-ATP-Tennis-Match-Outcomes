# Predicting-ATP-Tennis-Match-Outcomes

Aim: To predict outcomes of ATP tennis matches, based on Jeff Sackmanns tennis analytics repository https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp.

As of now, only Match-level statistics are considered. Point-level statistics are available in Jeff Sackmann's Match Charting Protect https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_MatchChartingProject.

ELO-ratings are also considered.

The interactive interpretML dashboards in the Machine Learnin Models notebook can be rendered here https://nbviewer.org/github/Alla977/.
